# Starbucks Customer Survey Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Starbucks Customer Survey dataset using R programming language. The purpose of this project is to learn and showcase various data manipulation and visualization techniques, including file handling, working with data frames, subsetting, data transformation using `mutate`, and data visualization using `ggplot`.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis consists of survey responses from a diverse group of over 100 individuals, providing insights into their purchasing behavior at Starbucks. The dataset includes 14 variables capturing demographic information, visitation frequency and timing, expenses, specific purchases, quality ratings, and other relevant data points. The income variable is measured in Malaysian Ringgit (RM).
